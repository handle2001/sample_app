# Ruby on Rails Tutorial sample application

This is the sample application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](https://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](https://www.michaelhartl.com/).

## License

All source code in the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/)
is available jointly under the MIT License and the Beerware License. See
[LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for details.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ gem install bundler -v 2.3.14
$ bundle _2.3.14_ config set --local without 'production'
$ bundle _2.3.14_ install
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
instructions for getting started with the application.5 (We won’t actually need to run rails db:migrate until Chapter 6, but it does no harm to include it now.)

5. The README also makes reference to a LICENSE file, which I’ve added by hand to the official reference implementation, but it isn’t present by default. You can download a copy from the reference implementation repo if you want it for completeness, but it’s not necessary for completing the tutorial.

Note: For convenience, the full reference app README contains additional advanced information not present in Listing 3.3.

Listing 3.3: An improved README file for the sample app.

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
